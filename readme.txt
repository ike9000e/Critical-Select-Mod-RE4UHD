Installation - Additional Notes

The enabler will automatically create a backup file. Backup file will appear with the .bkp extension, in the same directory the modified executable file is. If you planning to keep your own, manual backups, it can be deleted as it is not required for the mod to function correctly.

Manual Installation

This is for advanced users.

Copy "critical_select_mod_dll.dll" and "critical_select_mod_dll.ini" into the game directory - the "\Bin32" directory.
Use DLL injector program such as CFF Explorer VIII and add the DLL to the "bio4.exe".

Limitations

    Crit scaling doesn't work on most of boss enemies.
    Weapons or attacks that do 0 damage are not affected.
    Settings are not saved on game exit.
